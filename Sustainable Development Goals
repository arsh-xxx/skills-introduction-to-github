<h1>Sustainable Development Goals</h1>
<h2>What are Sustainable Development Goals?</h2>
<h3> The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) are a set of 17 global goals that aim to end poverty, protect the planet, and ensure peace and prosperity for all by 2030. They were adopted by the United Nations in 2015 as part of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, which is a shared blueprint for a better and more sustainable future. The SDGs cover various aspects of social, economic, and environmental development, such as health, education, gender equality, climate change, and biodiversity. The SDGs are interconnected and require the collaboration of all countries, sectors, and stakeholders to achieve them.</h3>
